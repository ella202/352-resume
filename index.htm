<strong>  Undergraduate student </strong><br>

<p>I'm an undergraduate journalism major and a music and culture minor with an admiration for all things music, art and entertainment. At the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism, I especially enjoy learning and producing radio broadcast, print and web journalism. Growing up in a city like DC, I've experienced so many different cultures which have molded me into the critic, writer, thinker and creator I am today.</p>
